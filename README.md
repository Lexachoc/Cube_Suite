# Cube Suite

[![Open in Streamlit](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://cubesuite.streamlit.app/)

Cube Suite is a powerful web app for processing and manipulating cube files used to visualize electronic densities and orbitals in computational chemistry. üî¨‚öõÔ∏è

With Cube Suite, you can:
‚ú® Calculate planar averaged and integrated densities
‚ö° Perform arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply) on cube files
üîÑ Raise cube files to a power
üî∫ Translate cube files
‚à´ Integrate cube files

The app is powered by the amazing [Cube Toolz](https://github.com/funkymunkycool/Cube-Toolz) Python library under the hood, which does all the heavy lifting computations. The cube files are then visualized using the awesome [py3dmol](https://py3dmol.org)! ü§©

## Web App

You can access the Cube Suite web app at [https://cubesuite.streamlit.app/](https://cubesuite.streamlit.app/).

## Features

- **Add, Subtract, or Multiply Cube Files**: Perform arithmetic operations on cube files.
- **Raise Cube File to a Power**: Raise the values in a cube file to a specified power.
- **Translate Cube File**: Translate a cube file along the x, y, or z-axis.
- **Calculate Planar Average**: Calculate the planar averaged density or integrated density from a cube file.
- **Integrate Cube File**: Integrate the values in a cube file.
- **Visualize Cube Files**: Visualize cube files using py3dmol, a powerful 3D molecular viewer.
